       <p>Hi! I'm Trevin and I'm majoring in Computer Science here as a freshman at BYUI.<p>
        
        <p>I enjoy listening to music. I also love to hangout with friends.<p>
        
        <p class="gray">I'm fascinated by the technogoly that surrounds us. Learning about careers in web design will help me figure out what I enjoy doing as I choose my future.</p>
</p>My favorite scripture is Doctrine and Covenants 18:15</p>
<p>And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto his people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!</p>
